Portfolio analysis tool built with react, firebase, bootstrap, and an external API.

This project still has a few issues but is in working condition. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-eXDZpeyig&ab_channel=PavelHalko 

It uses linear regression to analyze stock prices and give back data based on that.

To run this project, run it like you normally would run a react app. 

Since we do have depndencies, do not forget to run nmp install or if that doesn't work run npm install --force.

This project was built for a hackathon with an objective of working to develop team work skills as well as experience in programming.
